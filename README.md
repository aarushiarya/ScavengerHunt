# Digital Scavenger Hunt

### Time: 45 mins
### Instructor: Aarushi Arya

This workshop is targeted at those who have little to no programming experience. During this workshop, we will solve clues, get introduced to computer science concepts like how url works, text and image cryptography and have fun.

Aarushi will guide students through the clues from start to finish. Students will have the opportunity to provide input and set the pace of the scavenger hunt.

All of the clues and solution developed during the class session will be available in a GitHub repository which will be posted shortly after the conclusion of the session. Students are encouraged to check out the code and play with it themselves, friends and family

We will have two tracks - beginner and intermediate. 
The pace will be slow and more help will be given to the students in beginner track. We will provide for resources as well.
Intermediate track will go faster and students will be given more time to come up with the solution.
